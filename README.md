# bt-webgenie-collector

Stats collector for Bittensor Webgenie subnet

- - -

# Base requirements

- docker with [compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
- python 3.11
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes)

# Setup development environment

```sh
./setup-dev.sh
docker compose up -d
cd app/src
uv run manage.py wait_for_database --timeout 10
uv run manage.py migrate
uv run manage.py runserver
```

# Setup production environment (git deployment)

<details>

This sets up "deployment by pushing to git storage on remote", so that:

- `git push origin ...` just pushes code to Github / other storage without any consequences;
- `git push production master` pushes code to a remote server running the app and triggers a git hook to redeploy the application.

```
Local .git ------------> Origin .git
                \
                 ------> Production .git (redeploy on push)
```

- - -

Use `ssh-keygen` to generate a key pair for the server, then add read-only access to repository in "deployment keys" section (`ssh -A` is easy to use, but not safe).

```sh
# remote server
mkdir -p ~/repos
cd ~/repos
git init --bare --initial-branch=master bt-webgenie-collector.git

mkdir -p ~/domains/bt-webgenie-collector
```

```sh
# locally
git remote add production root@<server>:~/repos/bt-webgenie-collector.git
git push production master
```

```sh
# remote server
cd ~/repos/bt-webgenie-collector.git

cat <<'EOT' > hooks/post-receive
#!/bin/bash
unset GIT_INDEX_FILE
export ROOT=/root
export REPO=bt-webgenie-collector
while read oldrev newrev ref
do
    if [[ $ref =~ .*/master$ ]]; then
        export GIT_DIR="$ROOT/repos/$REPO.git/"
        export GIT_WORK_TREE="$ROOT/domains/$REPO/"
        git checkout -f master
        cd $GIT_WORK_TREE
        ./deploy.sh
    else
        echo "Doing nothing: only the master branch may be deployed on this server."
    fi
done
EOT

chmod +x hooks/post-receive
./hooks/post-receive
cd ~/domains/bt-webgenie-collector
sudo bin/prepare-os.sh
./setup-prod.sh

# adjust the `.env` file

mkdir letsencrypt
./letsencrypt_setup.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Deploy another branch

Only `master` branch is used to redeploy an application.
If one wants to deploy other branch, force may be used to push desired branch to remote's `master`:

```sh
git push --force production local-branch-to-deploy:master
```

# Background tasks with Celery

## Dead letter queue

<details>
There is a special queue named `dead_letter` that is used to store tasks
that failed for some reason.

A task should be annotated with `on_failure=send_to_dead_letter_queue`.
Once the reason of tasks failure is fixed, the task can be re-processed
by moving tasks from dead letter queue to the main one ("celery"):

    manage.py move_tasks "dead_letter" "celery"

If tasks fails again, it will be put back to dead letter queue.

To flush add tasks in specific queue, use

    manage.py flush_tasks "dead_letter"
</details>



# Monitoring

Running the app requires proper certificates to be put into `nginx/monitoring_certs`,
see [nginx/monitoring_certs/README.md](nginx/monitoring_certs/README.md) for more details.

## Monitoring execution time of code blocks

Somewhere, probably in `metrics.py`:

```python
some_calculation_time = prometheus_client.Histogram(
    'some_calculation_time',
    'How Long it took to calculate something',
    namespace='django',
    unit='seconds',
    labelnames=['task_type_for_example'],
    buckets=[0.5, 1, *range(2, 30, 2), *range(30, 75, 5), *range(75, 135, 15)]
)
```

Somewhere else:
 
```python
with some_calculation_time.labels('blabla').time():
    do_some_work()
```



# Cloud deployment

## AWS

<details>
Initiate the infrastructure with Terraform:
TODO

To push a new version of the application to AWS, just push to a branch named `deploy-$(ENVIRONMENT_NAME)`.
Typical values for `$(ENVIRONMENT_NAME)` are `prod` and `staging`.
For this to work, GitHub actions needs to be provided with credentials for an account that has the following policies enabled:

- AutoScalingFullAccess
- AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
- AmazonS3FullAccess

See `.github/workflows/cd.yml` to find out the secret names.

For more details see [README_AWS.md](README_AWS.md)
</details>

## Vultr

<details>
Initiate the infrastructure with Terraform and cloud-init:

- see Terraform template in `<project>/devops/vultr_tf/core/`
- see scripts for interacting with Vultr API in `<project>/devops/vultr_scripts/`
  - note these scripts need `vultr-cli` installed

For more details see [README_vultr.md](README_vultr.md).

# Backups

<details>
<summary>Click to for backup setup & recovery information</summary>

## Setting up periodic backups

Add to crontab:

```sh
# crontab -e
30 0 * * * cd ~/domains/bt-webgenie-collector && ./bin/backup-db.sh > ~/backup.log 2>&1
```

Set `BACKUP_LOCAL_ROTATE_KEEP_LAST` to keep only a specific number of most recent backups in local `.backups` directory.

## Configuring offsite targets for backups

Backups are put in `.backups` directory locally, additionally then can be stored offsite in following ways:

**Backblaze**

Set in `.env` file:

- `BACKUP_B2_BUCKET_NAME`
- `BACKUP_B2_KEY_ID`
- `BACKUP_B2_KEY_SECRET`

**Email**

Set in `.env` file:

- `EMAIL_HOST`
- `EMAIL_PORT`
- `EMAIL_HOST_USER`
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`
- `EMAIL_TARGET`

## Restoring system from backup after a catastrophical failure

1. Follow the instructions above to set up a new production environment
2. Restore the database using bin/restore-db.sh
3. See if everything works
4. Set up backups on the new machine
5. Make sure everything is filled up in .env, error reporting integration, email accounts etc
